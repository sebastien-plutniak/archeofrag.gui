Description: A 'Shiny' application to access the functionalities and datasets of the 'archeofrag' package for spatial analysis in archaeology from refitting data. Quick and seamless exploration of archaeological refitting datasets, focusing on physical refits only. Features include: built-in documentation and convenient workflow, plot generation and exports, anomaly detection in the spatial distribution of refitting connection, exploration of spatial units merging solutions, simulation of archaeological site formation processes, support for parallel computing, R code generation to re-execute simulations and ensure reproducibility, code generation for the 'openMOLE' model exploration software. A demonstration of the app is available at <https://analytics.huma-num.fr/Sebastien.Plutniak/archeofrag/>.
